## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning approach to stock price prediction using LSTM networks. The model analyzes 10 years of historical stock data to predict future stock prices. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation phases.

### Key Features:
- LSTM-based neural network architecture
- Rolling window prediction approach
- Multiple technical indicators integration
- Comparative analysis with moving averages
- Interactive visualization of predictions
